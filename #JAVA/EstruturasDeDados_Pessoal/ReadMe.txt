Hello, Stranger!

I'm Uriel, and this is my data structures' pack!

I'v made it basicaly because of my course, to the Data Structure's class. So i've decided to share on my portifolio,
once that i've made all the structures on my own. It's not a easy work, and it's still im progress.

In my next commit, it'll have more structures (like Linked List, Doble-Linked List, Binary Tree, Enary Tree) and they wiil
be parametrized (That means: you can use it with all object and types, with 0 of the problems it has using Object, like it's
now).

Enjoy the code! ^^
