Hello, stranger! This is me, Uriel A.

This is an entire new project i'm doing for myself (maybe to show me my own capacity).
It's an Questionary Program, to a teacher do it's own questionaries to his/her students. The principal motivation for this
is my professor, who needed some things from the Google Forms, but it hasn't. So... based in her needs, i decided to make
something, just for fun and, perhaps, help her.

I'll be updating it while i'm doing it, so it's a IN PROGRESS work.

ATT #0001:

Just Made it. Maybe i'll update it tomorow too.
