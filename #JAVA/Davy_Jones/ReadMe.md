Hello! I'm Proud to introduce you DAVY JONES.
This is a kind of a game, ok?

## The Game:
This is a Dice Game, where the first to acomplish a certain number of points, win!

Also, it has a card-based system that alows you to prejudice your adversary (And your adversary to prejudice you as well).

You play against the CPU.

## Rules
Int the game, you have the following itens to use:

- The Dices: Are the main object in da game; you have to use them to win the game.

- The Special Dices: They have four special effect in the round, changing with the sum of them.
- The D20 (BETA): IT can be used once per game, but it can be changed based in the game difficulty.

# The Dices:

When you "Play the Dices", it throws 6 dices. They are:
- The Golden Dices: Three dices of positive value.
- The Bloddy Dices: Three dices of negative value.

The result of the dices is based in the following equation:

SCORE += (GD1 + GD2 + GD3) - (BD1 + BD2 + BD3)

If the value is a negative number, it will subtract that value from your score.
If the value is a positive number, it will add that value from your score.

# The Cards:
The cards changes the rules of the game. They are ramdomly chosen by the computer. There is the following cards in the game:

-The Queen: It adds only the Golden Dice points to your score, discarding the Bloody Dices.
-The King: Makes your points equal to your adversary points, no matter if they are higher or minor than yours.
-The Jack: It adds to your score the Golden Dice points, and subtract the Bloddy Dice points of the Adversary's score.
-The JOKER: Passes your turn automaticaly.

# The Special Dices:

The Special Dicas can, ramdomly:
