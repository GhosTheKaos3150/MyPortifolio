Hello, im the stupid that created this mess.
I have plans to change this, but i don't know when.

I'm commiting this at 11-08-2018 (MM-DD-YYYY), But it was codded a year ago, when i didn't know OOP that much. So, all the classes
here are scrap. But i've made this and i'm proud, so it goes to my portifolio. When i change something, i chang this ReadMe file.

Oh, guess who doesn't commented on the code? Me (a year ago), when i doesn't know any Programming Good-Practices. So yeah, try to solve
this by you own. This will get better one day.
